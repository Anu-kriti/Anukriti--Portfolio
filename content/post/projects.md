**Email Engagement of Member**
•	Improved the methodology to define the members’ level of email engagement by including their interaction data from previous years. Also used Empirical Bayesian Model to predict the likelihood of a member opening an email in future 


**Pah Finder for Screening**
•	Identified an optimized path to target members for Breast Cancer Screening campaign to increase their engagement and to reduce unproductive communications using Decision Trees and Markov Model in PySpark

**Member Clustering**
•	Performed a  clustering exercise to understand the inbound callers and optimize their contact strategy on the basis of member level clusters using Big Data and PySpark 

**Plan Propensity Model**
•	Recommended the best plan mixture to be offered to a prospect based on the prospect’s similarity of attributes with members having the similar plan using Big Data and PySpark

**CAHPS prediction Analysis**
•	Performed deep dive analysis on CAHPS Survey to improve the accuracy of 9 CAHPS Measures:
•	Built 9 predictive multiclass models to identify low score responders using Xgboost, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network
•	To understand the extent at which different measures move together or differently
