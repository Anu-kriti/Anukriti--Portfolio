Correlation of service outages with key features were observed and only features having positively associated with outage were selected compared to usual approach of having all the features\n * *Model Used:*  The Random forest classifier was used to predict the probabilities of service outage. It’s an decision tree ensemble method which takes mandate from different trees to predict target variable. Different iteration of tree depth and number of tree were tested for best OOB error rate and optimally 200 Decision trees with depth of 5 gave best result\n\n## Model Accuracy\n AUC - 98.06954\n ",
